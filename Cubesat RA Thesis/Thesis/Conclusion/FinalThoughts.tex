This research used the Object Oriented Systems Engineering Method with SysML to create a CubeSat Reference Architecture. While originally intended to be used by students at AFIT in their Spacecraft Design Sequence, the model can be tailored to be used by other teams that have similar goals. 

This research delivered a variety of helpful tools for teams to use that makes their modeling efforts easier. Auto-populating tables and matrices, a library of parts and value properties to choose from, analysis patterns to tailor, and document generators will save time and hopefully improve the quality of CubeSat models going forward. Reports will also be more consistent and standardized according to stakeholder preference, and the work spaces provided encourage teams to use the model for storing all relevant data and analysis. Most importantly though, this Reference Architecture is cementing MBSE practices in teams who have limited experience with modeling tools, better preparing them for the future of spacecraft design.
