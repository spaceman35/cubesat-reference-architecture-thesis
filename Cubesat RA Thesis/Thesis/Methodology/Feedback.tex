The primary users of this Reference Architecture will be students going through the design sequence, but the instructors for those courses need to buy into this and understand the Reference Architecture. They will surely be asked questions about it and they decide what deliverables should look like, so instructor feedback was crucial throughout the development of this Reference Architecture. At the very beginning, before beginning modeling work, the three instructors were consulted for their desires and expectations and to note any changes in the course series going forward. Furthermore, once the Reference Architecture was ready for a demonstration, they were consulted again, this time providing specific feedback on tables, traceability matrices, and document composition. This feedback was extremely useful to keep the Reference Architecture in scope and to ensure it will be useful for the intended users.
