% A common file to store all figure definitions
%
% In preparing your thesis, one of the first things you should do is
% organize your figures.  Then, one of the last things you'll do is
% reorder your figures so they display where you want them to in the
% text.  Organizing figure definitions in a common files helps:
%
%   1. Write new figures using earlier examples.
%
%   2.  Isolate code and minimize the risk of introducing bugs in the
%   final editing process.  Trust me, moving around just one line of
%   code is easier.
%
%   3.  Reuse figures in other papers.  <=== the best reason!
%
% Note command names can not include numbers and special characters.
%
% To make the file more searchable, use naming conventions that map
% the graphics filename labSetup.jpg to the command name \figlabSetup to the
% figure label fig:labSetup.
