This Reference Architecture will use No Magic's Cameo Systems Modeler as the primary modeling tool. Cameo Systems Modeler was chosen as the modeling tool due to its common usage at AFIT and as it is being used more commonly in program offices in the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center. Mathworks' MATLAB will be used for analysis as it is a commonly used program in academia and throughout the Department of Defense, and it easily integrates with Cameo. Finally, \abbreviationFull[Apache's Velocity Templating Language]{VTL} will be used to generate documentation from the model elements. These tools will be used to develop a Reference Architecture that will be tested by students and then demonstrated to AFIT faculty for feedback. Once the Reference Architecture is accepted by the faculty, it will be used by students in the design course sequence and improved from then on.
