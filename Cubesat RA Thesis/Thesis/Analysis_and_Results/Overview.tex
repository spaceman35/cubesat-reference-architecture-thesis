Chapter \ref{analysisandresults} details the resulting Reference Architecture using the methodology in Chapter \ref{Methodology}. The first section will describe the overall layout and navigation of the model, and then each major section of the Reference Architecture will be explored, highlighting the most important diagrams and new features. An in-depth help guide is included in the Reference Architecture file, so this chapter will not serve as a manual for the tool.
