%The preview section of the introduction
The thesis follows a five-chapter format. Chapter \ref{Intro} presented the general issue, listed the research goals, provided the scope and general approach of this research, and listed assumptions and limitations. Chapter \ref{LitReview} provides a background on the current Reference Architectures in the CubeSat domain and how other Reference Architectures are being used in other fields. Chapter \ref{Methodology} describes the methodology used to address the problem statement and complete the research objectives. Chapter \ref{analysis} details the resulting Reference Architecture and accompanying analytical tools. Chapter \ref{conclusion} summarizes the contributions and limitations, and describes areas of future research to further refine and evolve the Reference Architectureâ€™s usefulness. 

Ultimately, the final objective of the thesis effort is to provide CubeSat designers and students with a useful baseline on which to design a system that meets mission requirements. Furthermore, those requirements should be validated at the logical and hardware levels using tools such as STK and MATLAB.
