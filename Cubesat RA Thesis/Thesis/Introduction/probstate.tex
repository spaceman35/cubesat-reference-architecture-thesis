%Problem Statement


Students in the Satellite Design course series at AFIT are starting to learn \abbreviationFull[Model-Based Systems Engineering]{MBSE} for their CubeSat designs, and there is a need for a Reference Architecture to streamline this design and development process. Using this Reference Architecture, the students will design better CubeSats in this course series and they will be prepared for spacecraft acquisitions in the US Space Force.
