% Assumptions and Limitations

There are of course some limitations to this research. The first is limited standardization amongst the CubeSat community. This thesis is based on how AFIT teaches MBSE and how AFIT names subsystems, requirements, and documents. Other design teams may have vastly different practices and conventions, limiting how useful the Reference Architecture may be right away. Second, this Reference Architecture uses Cameo Systems Modeler, a tool that might not be available or desired by users. Third, the Reference Architecture is sensitive to major organizational changes. If a user wishes to make drastic changes away from the provided structure, some analysis or document tools may need to be updated or they will not be useful. Finally, the analysis portion of this Reference Architecture is only useful for initial verification and validation of requirements, but does not replace more in-depth and robust analysis. This tool can help rapidly prototype and determine feasibility, but would not suffice for final approval to launch.
