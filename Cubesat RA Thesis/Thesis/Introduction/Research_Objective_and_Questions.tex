\noindent \textbf{The research objectives are:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Create a practical and useful baseline Reference Architecture for the ASYS 531, ASYS 631, and ASYS 632 course series.}
\item{Create easy-to-use document generators that use model elements to generate traditional system level review documents.}
\item{Present examples of this Reference Architecture to the course instructors to show the utility.}
\item{Lay the groundwork for future analysis work with STK and MATLAB integration for more comprehensive mission analysis.}
\end{enumerate}



\noindent \textbf{The research questions are:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{What are the modeling tools necessary to perform mission modeling verification using model-based systems engineering?}
\item{How can the OOSEM method improve existing CubeSat reference architecture, and its use within the AFIT Space Systems design sequence?}
\item{What needs to be done in the model to allow for external tools (STK, MATLAB, etc.) to interact with the MBSE tool?}
\item{Can cloud-based collaboration improve the MBSE and design process for interdisciplinary teams?}

\end{enumerate}
