The purpose of this chapter is to highlight the current state of Reference Architectures, including some recent work in the CubeSat domain. To understand the context, this chapter will start by describing the CubeSat domain and the need for a Reference Architecture for AFIT students' use. This chapter will also define key terms and explore gaps in the existing CubeSat Reference Architectures. Reference Architectures in the CubeSat domain are still a relatively new endeavor, but Reference Architectures in similar domains will be researched to learn lessons from those models.
