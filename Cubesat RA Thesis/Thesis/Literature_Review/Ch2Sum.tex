This chapter discussed the CubeSat context and explained the necessary MBSE and OOSEM concepts to understand the rest of this thesis. After the MBSE language, method, and tools were explained, Reference Architectures were defined, providing a template for the modeler to start from. Current Reference Architectures were then examined, including an AFIT-developed SUAS architecture and two existing CubeSat Reference Models. Gaps in these Reference Architectures were then identified that this thesis will attempt to solve. Next, a Digital Engineering Validation Tool was explored to determine its utility in this Reference Architecture. Finally, previous document generators were discussed to highlight what this thesis aims to improve.
