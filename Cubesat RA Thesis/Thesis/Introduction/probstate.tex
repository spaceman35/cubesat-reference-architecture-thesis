%Problem Statement
(if it should be a short statement)
There is a need for a Reference Architecture to allow design teams to rapidly develop, simulate, and test CubeSat designs and generate traditional documentation, all from one \abbreviationFull[Model-Based Systems Engineering]{MBSE} tool.

(if it should be a Problem Description instead)
As design teams begin the development process of a CubeSat, there is a steep learning curve for many. Many engineers are not familiar with MBSE tools or methodology, and teams need to start their designs from scratch. Reference Architectures exist in other domains to capture best practices and provide a starting point for new systems, so this thesis attempts to develop and demonstrate a Reference Architecture for the CubeSat domain. By providing CubeSat designers with a template, including automatically generating tables and documentation, they can focus more on the design and less on learning how to use and organize the complicated model. Additionally, by providing a component library to use and pre-built analysis tools using those components, they can build off previous successful designs and rapidly simulate candidate solutions. Thorough documentation and guidance included in the Reference Architecture will also increase standardization amongst the design team.
