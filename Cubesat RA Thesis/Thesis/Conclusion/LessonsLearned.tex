%     \textbf{SITL and Automated Testing} \\ \hline
%     - Determine if a physics model is used in Ardupilot SITL.  Incorporate more accurate models of the X-8 using JSBSim or similar tools.   Explore the effects of altering autopilot tuning parameters on swarm behavior. \\ 
%     - Automate the testing framework to reduce manual tasks for launching vehicles and algorithm code. \\ 
%     - Integrate automated analysis for testing to verify code changes, calculate flight statistics, or other relevant data. \\ 
%     - Introduce fault injection, degraded states, environment effects, and time delays in testing. \\ 
%     - Increase number of vehicles in the swarm. \\ 
%     - Add new variables to broadcast data in LCM messages such as autopilot mode and centroid calculation to better facilitate data analysis and grooming. \\ \hline
%     \textbf{Flight Testing} \\ \hline
%     - Verify required output data is present in log files during ground tests. \\
%     - Smaller way-point path to increase sorties per battery
%     - Higher $v_{max}$ for follower vehicles to allow gap closure to leader. \\
%     - Hold leader at way-point 1 before beginning tests to allow follower stability. \\
%     - Have all in `GUIDED' at conclusion of way-points to collect three-vehicle swarm stability data. \\
%     - Establish and follow start-up sequences. \\ \hline
%     \textbf{Hardware Changes} \\ \hline
%     - Update to Pixhawk 2 or PX4 autopilot. \\
%     - Incorporate RTK GPS for closer swarming capability. \\
%     - Change from BBB to ODROID for faster processing and to avoid clock resets during power-offs. \\ \hline
%     \textbf{LCM Tests} \\ \hline
%     - Synchronize log start times for more accurate message delay timing. \\ 
%     - Determine why some log times progressed at a higher rate. \\ \hline
%     \textbf{Algorithm Changes} \\ \hline
%     - Add or explore new rules for testing such as home location gravitation. \\
%     - Test for optimal parameter values, i.e. $b$, $r_{min}$, $u$. \\
%     - Alter code loop rates for different information streams. \\
%     - Incorporate predictive analysis of other swarm members to aid in degraded states. \\
%     - Introduce swarm damping parameter to reduce oscillations. \\
%     - Determine exact cause of unresponsive vehicles. \\ \hline
%     \textbf{Other} \\ \hline
%     - Broadcast UgCS telemetry via mesh network. \\
%     - Test mesh network concept for long ranges. \\
%     - Determine network bandwidth limitations for additional swarm members. \\ \hline
